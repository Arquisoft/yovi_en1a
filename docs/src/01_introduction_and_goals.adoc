== Introduction and Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****
endif::arc42help[]

=== Requirements Overview
The project aims to develop a full-stack web application for a game named YOVI,
communicating human players and automated agents. The following high level specifications
must be in the final version of the application:

* **Gameplay Engine:** An front-end implementation based on the "Classic" version of Game Y.
** **Player-vs-Machine:** Mode with adjustable board dimensions.
** **Strategies:** Selectable difficulty levels and logic.
* **User Management:**
** Secure registration and authentication.
** Personal dashboards with win/loss statistics and match history.
* **Developer API:**
** Publicly accessible and fully documented.
** Support for **YEN notation** via a `/play` endpoint.

.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Goals
[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Goal | Description

| *Availability*
| The application and its API must be publicly accessible and maintain high uptime for both web users and bot integrations.

| *Compatibility*
| The API must strictly adhere to the **YEN notation** standard to ensure that any external bot can communicate with the game engine without formatting errors.

| *Usability*
| The frontend should be intuitive, allowing users to easily toggle between game strategies and view their statistics without a steep learning curve.

| *Scalability*
| The backend architecture should handle concurrent matches from both web users and API-based bots without significant latency.

| *Security*
| User data and match histories must be protected via secure authentication, ensuring users can only manage their own profiles.

.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
