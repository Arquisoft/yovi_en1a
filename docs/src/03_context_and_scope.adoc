== Context and Scope

The YOVI_0 system (Game Y at UniOvi) is a distributed gaming platform designed to provide a competitive environment for both human players and automated agents. The system's primary boundary lies between the user-facing web interface and the high-performance game logic engine implemented in Rust.

=== 3.1. Business Context

The business context defines how YOVI_0 interacts with external entities. The system acts as a standardized provider for both human players and third-party bots, ensuring interoperability through the YEN notation.

|Communication Partner |Inputs |Outputs
|**Human Player**
|Account registration data (username/password), game moves via the hexagonal board UI, and selection of AI difficulty/strategy.
|Real-time board updates, personal performance statistics (win/loss ratios), and historical match records.

|**External Bots**
|RESTful API requests containing current board states in **YEN notation**.
|Calculated next moves in YEN notation and validation of whether a specific game state is a "win" or "loss".

|**Micrati Developers / Admins**
|Infrastructure configuration, CI/CD scripts, and Docker container management.
|Application health metrics, observability data via logs, and test coverage reports.
|===

**External Domain Interfaces:**
* **YEN Notation:** This is the primary domain language. It is a JSON-based representation of the board that ensures that any external subsystem can understand the current turn, player list, and piece layout.
* **Coordinate Systems:** The system accepts both **Barycentric (x,y,z)** and **Index-based** coordinates to allow for different mathematical approaches by bot developers.

=== 3.2. Technical Context

The YOVI_0 architecture is based on a microservices-inspired model. All communication between the React-based frontend and the specialized services is handled over asynchronous and synchronous network calls.

|Interface |Protocol |Description
|**Client Browser**
|HTTPS / TCP
|The entry point for the user. It delivers the React Single Page Application (SPA). Once loaded, the SPA handles all subsequent business logic calls via fetch/axios.

|**Internal Services**
|HTTP / JSON
|Communication between the Webapp and the **Node.js User Service** (Port 3000) and the **Rust GameY Engine** (Port 4000).

|**Public Bot API**
|REST / JSON
|A public-facing endpoint allowing third-party applications to interact with the game engine. It follows a strict request-response pattern using the YEN standard.
|===

**Mapping Input/Output to Channels:**

* **Game Logic Flow:** When a user or bot submits a move, the Webapp sends a JSON POST request to the Rust service. The Rust service parses the YEN layout, validates the move, and returns a JSON response containing the updated state.
* **Authentication Flow:** User credentials from the registration form are sent via HTTP POST to the User Service, which processes the simulation and returns a welcome status.
* **Observability:** Logs generated by the Node.js and Rust environments are mapped to the standard output of their respective Docker containers, accessible via the technical management console.
