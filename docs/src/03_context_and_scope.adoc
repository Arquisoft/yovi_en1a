== Context and Scope

The YOVI_0 system (Game Y at UniOvi) is a distributed gaming platform designed to provide a competitive environment for both human players and automated agents. The system's primary boundary lies between the user-facing web interface and the high-performance game logic engine implemented in Rust.

=== 3.1. Business Context

The business context defines how YOVI_0 interacts with external entities. The system acts as a standardized provider for both human players and third-party bots, ensuring interoperability through the **YEN notation**.

|Communication Partner |Inputs |Outputs
|**Human Player**
|Account registration data, game moves via hexagonal UI, and selection of AI strategy.
|Real-time board updates, personal performance statistics, and historical match records.

|**External Bots**
|RESTful API requests containing current board states in **YEN notation**.
|Calculated next moves in YEN notation and game-state validation.

|**Micrati Developers / Admins**
|Infrastructure configuration, CI/CD scripts, and Docker management.
|Application health metrics, observability logs, and test coverage reports.
|===

**External Domain Interfaces:**
* **YEN Notation:** The primary domain language. It is a JSON-based representation ensuring interoperability between any external subsystem.
* **Coordinate Systems:** Supports both **Barycentric (x,y,z)** and **Index-based** coordinates to accommodate different mathematical approaches by bot developers.

=== 3.2. Technical Context

The YOVI_0 architecture follows a microservices-inspired model. All communication between the React-based frontend and the specialized services is handled over network calls.

|===
|Interface |Protocol |Description
|**Client Browser**
|HTTPS / TCP
|The entry point for the user. Delivers the React SPA, which subsequently handles business logic via fetch/axios.

|**Internal Services**
|HTTP / JSON
|Communication between the Webapp and the **Node.js User Service** (Port 3000) and the **Rust GameY Engine** (Port 4000).

|**Public Bot API**
|REST / JSON
|A public endpoint allowing third-party applications to interact with the game engine using the YEN standard.
|===

**Mapping Input/Output to Channels:**

* **Game Logic Flow:** Move submissions are sent via JSON POST to the Rust service. The service parses the YEN layout, validates the move, and returns the updated state.
* **Authentication Flow:** Credentials are sent via HTTP POST to the User Service, which processes the persistence simulation and returns a status code.
* **Observability:** Logs from Node.js and Rust are mapped to standard Docker output (`stdout`), accessible via the technical management console.
