.Contents
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape system architecture. It includes

* technology decisions
* decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
* decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

.Motivation
These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the foundation for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

.Form
Keep the explanations of such key decisions short.

Motivate what was decided and why it was decided that way,
based upon problem statement, quality goals and key constraints.
Refer to details in the following sections.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-4/[Solution Strategy] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Technology Decisions
|===
| Decision | Technology | Motivation
| **Logic Engine** | Rust | High-performance execution of game rules and AI move calculations with guaranteed memory safety.
| **Frontend** | React.js | Facilitates efficient state management for the complex hexagonal grid UI.
| **User Service** | Node.js | Non-blocking I/O ideal for handling concurrent API requests for users and statistics.
| **Database** | MongoDB | Document-based storage naturally fits the YEN Notation (JSON) format and allows for flexible player statistics.
| **Interoperability** | YEN Notation | A standardized JSON-based language that ensures any external bot can communicate with the engine.

=== Top-level Decomposition

The system follows a Microservices-oriented decomposition to ensure a clean separation of concerns:
 **Webapp (React):** Serves as the primary entry point and "Gateway" for both human users and external bot API requests.**Logic Engine (Rust):** A stateless service dedicated to game rule validation and AI calculations. **User Service (Node.js):** Manages the business logic for user accounts and statistics, communicating directly with the MongoDB cluster.

=== Achievement of Quality Goals

* **Interoperability:** By implementing the YEN Notation across all layers, the system allows bots using different mathematical models (Barycentric/Index) to compete seamlessly.
* **Persistence & Flexibility:** Using MongoDB ensures that as the game evolves (e.g., adding new bot metrics or match data), the system can adapt the data structure dynamically.
* **Performance:** Strategic offloading of computational logic to Rust ensures that the system meets the real-time requirements of a competitive gaming platform.

=== Organizational Decisions

* **Containerization (Docker):** To maintain consistency across different development environments, each component (React, Node, Rust, MongoDB) is containerized, ensuring the "Technical Context" is replicated exactly during deployment.
