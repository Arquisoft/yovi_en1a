== Constraints

=== Technical Constraints
Technical constraints define the specific technologies and tools that must be used.

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Constraint |Description

|**Programming Languages**
|Frontend must be **TypeScript/React**. The core Game Y logic (win verification/suggestions) must be **Rust**.

|**Data Exchange**
|All subsystem communication must use **JSON** formatted according to the **YEN notation** (size, turn, players, layout).

|**Deployment & Runtime**
|The system must be containerized with **Docker** and run on an **Ubuntu Linux** environment (Microsoft Azure).

|**External Connectivity**
|The system must expose a documented **Web API** accessible by third-party bots for automated gameplay.
|===

=== Architectural Constraints
Architectural constraints are the high-level design requirements that dictate the system's structure.

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Constraint |Description

|**Subsystem Decoupling**
|The system must be split into at least **two distinct subsystems** (Web App and Rust Module). They must remain independent and communicate only via web services.

|**Stateless Logic**
|The Rust module should ideally operate as a **stateless service**, taking a YEN state as input and returning a move/verification without maintaining local session state.

|**Strategy Extensibility**
|The architecture must support **multiple AI strategies** and difficulty levels, selectable by the user or the bot via the API.

|**Multi-Coordinate Support**
|The system must handle both **Barycentric (x,y,z)** and **Index-based (0...n)** coordinate systems, ensuring correct mapping between the UI and the Engine.
|===

=== Organizational Constraints
Organizational constraints relate to the project management and academic requirements.

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Constraint |Description

|**Academic Framework**
|Must satisfy all criteria for the **ASW assignment**, including traceability and quality attributes.

|**Team Workflow**
|Mandatory use of **Git** for version control, featuring documented **Code Reviews** and **Issue Tracking**.

|**Documentation Standard**
|Architecture must be documented using the **arc42 template** and include **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)**.

|**Evaluation Metrics**
|The system must be evaluated on **Availability and Observability (Monitoring)** and **Testing Coverage**.
|===

=== Conventions
Conventions are the rules agreed upon by the team to ensure consistency.

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Convention |Description

|**Language**
|English is the mandatory language for code, documentation, and the API.

|**API Documentation**
|All endpoints must be fully documented.

|**Modeling**
|Diagrams must follow **UML standards** and be rendered using software such as PlantUML.

|**Naming Conventions**
|Follow standard TypeScript (camelCase) and Rust (snake_case) style guides respectively.
